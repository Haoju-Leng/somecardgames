## Overview

An online solitaire card game website that used ReactJS as fronend and NodeJS as backend. The website is running at AWS server. Feel free to go to the website and give it a try!(It's not a fancy website but it has all functionality to register and play)

If the website can't be reached, the author (me) might closed the server at AWS since it cost money each month. Hope you find this website before I close the server:)
